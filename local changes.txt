How do you see the files changed within each commit using GitHub Desktop GUI?

What does HEAD refer to in the context of git?

We can see the files changed under CHANGES 
We see it on Local changes, it should say there's a new change - push to github
discard the changes on the local desctop github by the right click
The HEAD in Git is the pointer to the current branch reference, 
which is a pointer to the last commit we made or the last commit that was checked out into our working directory.
